    <description>This package provides helper functions that re-introduces helpers that were removed or updated
in Chocolatey, as well as helpers that are not available in older version of Chocolatey CLI.
The purpose of the package is to allow older packages to keep functioning even on later versions
of Chocolatey CLI where certain helpers have been removed.

The helpers included in this package may not have any logic to handle the functionality to keep
existing, but rather to ensure that packages using the helpers do not stop working.

**WARNING: Do NOT use helpers located in this package for removed functionality, unless absolutely necessary!**</description>
