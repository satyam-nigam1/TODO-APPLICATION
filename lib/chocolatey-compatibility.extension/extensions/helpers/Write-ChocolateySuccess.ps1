function Write-ChocolateySuccess {

  .SYNOPSIS
  DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE.

  .DESCRIPTION
  Writes a success message for a package.

  .NOTES
  This has been deprecated and is no longer useful as of 0.9.9. Instead
  please just use `throw $_.Exception` when catching errors. Although
  try/catch is no longer necessary unless you want to do some error
  handling.
  As the recommendation is to no longer use this function, no updates
  will be accepted to fix any problems.

  .INPUTS
  None

  .OUTPUTS
  None

  .PARAMETER PackageName
  The name of the package - while this is an arbitrary value, it's
  recommended that it matches the package id.

  .PARAMETER IgnoredArguments
  Allows splatting with arguments that do not apply. Do not use directly.
