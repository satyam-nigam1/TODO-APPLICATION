.SYNOPSIS
    Ensure that process is stopped in reliable way

.DESCRIPTION

.EXAMPLE
    notepad; Remove-Process notepad -PathFilter 'system32'

    Close main window of notepad that has 'system32' word in its path

.EXAMPLE
    Remove-Process notepad -WaitFor 30
    notepad; notepad  #in another shell

    Close all instances of notepad but wait for them up to 30 seconds to start

.OUTPUTS
    Array of closeed processes with details about each one.
