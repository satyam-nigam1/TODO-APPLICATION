function Write-ChocolateyFailure {
  <#
  .SYNOPSIS
  DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE. This function was removed in Chocolatey v1.

  .DESCRIPTION
  Throws the error message as an error.

  .NOTES
  This has been deprecated and was no longer useful as of 0.9.9,
  in 1.0.0 this function was removed entirely from Chocolatey CLI. Instead
  please just use `throw $_.Exception` when catching errors. Although
  try/catch is no longer necessary unless you want to do some error
  handling.
  As the recommendation is to no longer use this function, no updates
  will be accepted to fix any problems.

  .PARAMETER PackageName

  recommended that it matches the package id.

  .PARAMETER FailureMessage
  The message to throw an error with.

  .PARAMETER IgnoredArguments
  Allows splatting with arguments that do not apply. Do not use directly.
