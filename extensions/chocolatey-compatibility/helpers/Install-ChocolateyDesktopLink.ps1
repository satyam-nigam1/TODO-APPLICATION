function Install-ChocolateyDesktopLink {
  <#
  .SYNOPSIS
  DEPRECATED - This adds a shortcut on the desktop to the specified file path.

  .DESCRIPTION
  Determines the desktop folder and creates a shortcut to the specified
  file path. Will not throw errors if it fails.
  It is recommended you use `Install-ChocolateyShortcut` instead of this
  method as this has been removed upstream.

  .NOTES
  This function was removed and deprecated in Chocolatey CLI in favor of using
  https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/functions/install-chocolateyshortcut.
  As the recommendation is to no longer use this function, no updates
  will be accepted to fix any problems.
  Compared to original function that was available in Chocolatey CLI, this
  implementation do not include any error handling, nor any promise that shortcuts
  will be created in the same way as Chocolatey CLI did it.

  .PARAMETER TargetFilePath
  This is the location to the application/executable file that you want to
  add a shortcut to on the desktop.  This is mandatory.
